## Instructions for the tasks.
There is an individual python file for every task.

| Task number | File name |
| :---------: | :-------: |
|   Task 1    | task_1.py |
|   Task 2    | task_2.py |
|   Task 3    | task_3.py |
|   Task 4    | task_4.py |
|   Task 5    | task_5.py |
|   Task 7    | task_7.py |


The tasks can be run just by running the python file normally

Tasks 2 and 4 use the MSH-WSD dataset. This is a licenced dataset so we can't share it forward without permission.

The path to the dataset is defined in both tasks as shown: `directory = "MSHCorpus/MSHCorpus/"`

To change the path, just go to task_2.py and task_4.py to change that respective value
